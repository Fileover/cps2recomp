// Street Fighter Alpha: the court (the toolkit's ball game, fight/court.h; docs/COURT.md): where the game keeps what the

// on the ball, knocked down by the ball, its health kept full). The game's own code is used as it is, hooked: the push
// that keeps the two apart (00F2FC) is the court's while it runs (each kept on its half), a throw's catch (020F80,
// 021032) goes to its test's "no", and what the ball does to a fighter is made at its step (training.cpp, PlayerStep:
