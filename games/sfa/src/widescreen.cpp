// Street Fighter Alpha: widescreen, as Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Vampire Savior have it. A fight is shown 512 columns
// wide where the board shows 384 (16:9 for 4:3, the height and the size of everything as they were): more of the stage
// on each side. The fight is played in that picture too: the players can go to its edges, and the camera stops where
// its edges come to the stage's ends (64 nearer the middle at each end). With the feature off none of that is there and
// the game is the board's. It is off in every preset: it changes how the game plays.
//
// With "Invisible walls" (widescreen_walls) as well, the fight is shown in the wide picture but played as on the
// board: nothing here touches the rules (the margin is 0), so the players are stopped where the board's picture ends
// and the camera goes as far as the board's does. Only the picture is wider, and near a stage's end the view is kept
// inside the stage, so the board's picture is then off the middle of the wide one.
//
// The rules the wide picture changes are written again here as readable C++ (rewrites: lift.h), each with the margin
// as a line in it: the camera's place across and up (its ends 64 nearer the middle; a mode's wanted place: battle.h),
// and keeping the players inside the picture (64 further out on each side; the ring out lets one over an end).
