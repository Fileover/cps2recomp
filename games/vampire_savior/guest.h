// Vampire Savior (vsavj) as a guest: its stages behind another game's fighters (fight/guest_stages.h). Its facts, found
// for its port (src/vsav.h, src/training.cpp, src/machines.cpp, family.h): A5 = FF8000; the game's steps FF8000 (2 a
// game), FF8004 (2 the character choice, 4 the match), FF8008 (4 a round), FF800C (6 the round fought); credits FF8076;
// who is in FF808D; a two-player match's stage chosen at 00AE7C and put at FF8100 (the stage's number doubled) by
// 00AEC4, the routine's end at 00AEC8 (where the stage wanted goes in its place); the round's clock FF8109 (seconds, 99
// at most); the camera asks where the players are at 01E8F4 (their outer edges, D0 and D1) and 01E962 (their heights,
// D0 the lower, D1 the higher); objects in colour sets below 22, and the players' shadows, are not the stage's.
