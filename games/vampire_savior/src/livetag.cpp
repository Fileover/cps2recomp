// Vampire Savior: swapping a player's fighter in the middle of a fight, for the team battle's tag style (fight/battle.h).
// The game sets the player up again itself: its routine's step 0 (0222C8) clears the record from +80 to +37F, sets the
// health, the armour, the palette slot and the first animation, calls the character's own setting up (a routine by
// number at BD0FA), and plays no entrance (the player's bit at A5+102 set). What the outgoing character made (objects
// from the game's pools that name its record at +30 or +32, and its links at +28-+2E) is given back first, as the game
// gives an object back, or it would run on with another character in the record (Q-Bee's and Lilith's crashed the
// game). The colours are put in on the next frame. Checked with every pair of the fifteen swapped back and forth under
// made-up play (PROGRESS.md).
//
// For tests, VSAV_SWAP=FRAME:PLAYER:CHARACTER,... (hex character) swaps outside the team battle, at that frame or, with
// VSAV_SWAP_FREE, as soon after as the player can act.
