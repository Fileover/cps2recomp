// game's: its camera, when a stage is shown, its objects that are not its stage's, its stage tunes, and which stage is
// wanted. Vampire Savior Definitive, built from these sources too, has its own (games/vsav_definitive/src/stages.cpp:
// its Darkstalkers' stages by the opponent); family.h says which game calls this.
//
// Which: a stage chosen by name (training's, versus's, the stage viewer's: the guests' after this game's twelve), or,
// with the "Other games' stages" feature, an arcade match's stage is one of theirs, the same one for the same match.
