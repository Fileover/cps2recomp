// Street Fighter Alpha 3: what the training dummy and the computer's coach need to know of guarding, read the way the
// game itself reads it (nothing here writes the game's memory).
//
// The guard-range test (02AB24) says whether something is near enough for the player to guard: the game asks it of a
// player holding away from the other (or with the board's auto guard), and puts the player in its guarding pose when
// it says yes. Here it is asked without the holding away, for a dummy that is to guard as a person holding away would.
// When a hit lands, the guard decision (023E26) takes the victim's pose (its animation frame's +0D) and the attack's
// bits of the poses that cannot guard it.
