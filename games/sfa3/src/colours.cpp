// Street Fighter Alpha 3: the players' own colours for the characters and the colour editor, which are the toolkit's
// (fight/colours.h). These are the game's facts for them: where its characters' colours are, the ROM file PalMod
// changes, and how the editor shows a set on player 1 in the model viewer (model.cpp).
//
// A character's colours are in the ROM from the table at kColourTable: a word a character (by its number) of how far
// on from the table its colours are, six sets there, each five palettes of 16 colours (words, 4 bits each of red,
// green and blue; the game keeps the brightness the palette buffer had). The set is the player's ism and its colour
// choice: (ism + 1) * 2 + choice, the ism FF for X, 0 for A, 1 for V, the choice 0 when the ism was chosen with a punch
// and 1 with a kick. When a round starts the game works the set out (01F95C), keeps where it is at the player's long
// kColours and where its palettes go at kColoursTo (the buffer the board shows from: 90C000 for player 1, 90C0A0 for
// player 2, the colour sets the player's +0D names), and copies all five there. The effects' palettes (fireballs, the
// supers' trails) are single palettes from the tables at 3329D4 and 34A7B4 (030306, 03037A), put back from kColours as
// they end (0303BE). Found from the routine that sets kColours, with the ism byte held at each value in a fight.
