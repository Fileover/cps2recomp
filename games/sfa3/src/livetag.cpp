// Street Fighter Alpha 3: swapping a player's fighter in the middle of a fight, for the team battle's tag style
// (fight/battle.h), as Alpha 2's livetag.cpp does it. The game sets the player up again itself: its routine's step 0
// (027B66) clears +80 to +FF and +180 to +3FF and a few bytes more (the character +102, the colour choice +128 and the
// ism +132 are kept), sets the health, calls the character's own setting up (a routine by number, the table at 0DD192:
// 027C54) and, in a match's first round (+159 set), its entrance (027C72). So a swap is what the outgoing character
// made given back, the character's byte, its colours and the state put at 0; the game does the rest at its next step,
// with no entrance and where the player was (hooks). The colours are put in on the next frame.
//
// For tests, SFA3_SWAP=FRAME:PLAYER:CHARACTER,... (hex character) swaps outside the team battle, at that frame or, with
// SFA3_SWAP_FREE, as soon after as the player can act; SFA3_TAG_LOG writes the characters and the lying as they change.
