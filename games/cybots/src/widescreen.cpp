// Cyberbots: widescreen, as Night Warriors, Pocket Fighter, the Alpha games and Vampire Savior have it. A fight is
// shown 512 columns wide where the board shows 384 (16:9 for 4:3, the height and the size of everything as they were):
// more of the stage on each side. The fight is played in that picture too: the players can go to its edges, and the
// camera stops where its edges come to the stage's ends (64 nearer the middle at each end). With the feature off none of
// that is there and the game is the board's. It is off in every preset: it changes how the game plays.
//
// With "Invisible walls" (widescreen_walls) as well, the fight is shown in the wide picture but played as on the
// board: nothing here touches the rules (the margin is 0), and near a stage's end the view is kept inside the stage.
//
// The rules the wide picture changes, each with the margin in it, are the game's own code done here when the margin is
// not 0 (with it 0 the game's code runs): the camera's step across (017FCC to the right and 01800E to the left keep it
// inside its ends: words at A5+6B1E and A5+6B20, 0 and 0x280) and keeping a player inside the picture (003782, which
// also lets the ring out's player over an end: battle.h).
