# Progear Recomp

> Part of **[CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md)**: one download and one launcher for every Capcom arcade game this
> project has ported. This page is about Progear; the [main page](../../README.md) says how to download and play.

An unofficial native PC port of the arcade game *Progear* (Cave, published by Capcom, 2001, CPS-2 board) for macOS,
Linux (Steam Deck included) and Windows, made by static recompilation: a horizontal shoot-'em-up for one or two
players, with a practice mode, a score attack, a caravan, a boss rush, free play, the board's own settings and cheats.

> **Beta.** The game plays through its five stages and into its second loop in made-up play and its code is checked
> instruction by instruction, but nobody has played it by hand yet, and its sound has not been listened to. Expect rough
> edges, and please [report what you find](#feedback-and-contributing).

**No game files are included.** You need your own copy of the game: the arcade ROM set `progearu` (USA, 010117), from
a board you own, or the Asian set of the same date. This project cannot help you get one.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Capcom or Cave. *Progear* is a trademark of Capcom.

## What it is

The game's 68000 program is translated ahead of time into C++ and compiled into the port, and so is its sound
program. What the program expects of the board is code written for this project, not an emulator: the CPS-2's video,
its inputs, its settings memory and QSound.

- **One or two players at once**, each with a keyboard layout or a gamepad of their own, and **online** against
  another player (rollback, as the other games). The buttons are what the game has: **Shot**, **Bomb** and
  **Rapid shot**, which shoots by itself while held when the Board page's rapid fire is on (the board's own is off).
- An in-game menu (Esc or `F1`; on a gamepad, the left stick's click or Start and Select together) with save states,
  speed (1/8 to 8x: slow motion), pause and frame advance, rapid fire, run-ahead, the board's timing (its slowdown),
  the cheats and every feature.
- **Pure** plays exactly as the board does. **Enhanced** (the default) adds free play (the board's own). Every other
  feature is a switch of its own.
- **Practice**: any of the five stages, from its start or straight at its boss, with the pilot and gunner, ships, bombs
  and shot power you choose. One button (Backspace, or a gamepad's left shoulder) puts it back as it began, at once; another
  replays your last attempt. Its aids: each ship's true hit box (4 pixels square, far smaller than the ship), the point
  of every enemy shot and the enemies' bodies, a readout of the shot's power, and a summary when a boss comes and at each stage's end (the time, the
  points scored, ships lost, bombs used). The cheats work in practice too. [All about practice →](../../docs/PRACTICE.md)
- **Alternative modes**, at the head of the in-game menu:
  - **Score attack**: one player and one credit from the first stage, no continue and no cheats; the best score is
    kept.
  - **Caravan**: two, three or five minutes from the first stage, a ship for every one lost; the best score in the time
    is kept for each length.
  - **Boss rush**: every boss in turn, the way between them run unseen; the best score is kept, and the time.
  - **Stage viewer**: a stage scrolling by with nobody on it: no ships, enemies, shots or panel.
  - **Attract mode**: the game's own show on a loop, with its sound on: all of it, or only the demonstrations.
- **Start at stage**: a new game starts at the beginning of any of the five stages.
- **Custom soundtrack**: your own music files in place of the board's music ([how](../../docs/SOUNDTRACK.md)); the
  game names its pieces in `songs.txt`.
- **Cheats**: infinite ships, infinite bombs, and invincibility for each player.
- The board's operator settings on the Board page (difficulty, ships, extra ships, rapid fire, continue, demo sound),
  each as the board is set unless you choose; or the game's own test menu from the in-game menu.
- **Straight to the title**: at a start or a reset, the board's start, its warning and the logos run unseen.
- Your ROM set is only ever read. Settings, save states and the board's settings memory go in your own user folder,
  or beside the launcher in [portable mode](../../docs/LAUNCHER.md#portable-mode).

## What you need

- The ROM set `progearu` (*Progear*, USA 010117): `progearu.zip` (with `progear.zip` beside it if your collection
  keeps the shared graphics and sound there) or a folder with the set's files, the key file `progearu.key` among them.
  Older collections call this set `progear` (its key `progear.key`): such a zip plays as it is; in a folder, name the
  key `progearu.key`. The Asian set (`progeara`) of the same date plays
  too. The launcher checks every file by checksum and tells you which is missing or different.
- One of: macOS 13 or later (Apple silicon or Intel); Linux x86_64 or arm64, or SteamOS; Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- For two players: two gamepads, or keys chosen for the second player on the Controllers page.

## Playing

Progear comes with [CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md#getting-started): open its launcher and show it your ROM set (drop
`progearu.zip` or its folder on the window, or choose the folder you keep your sets in), then press **Play** beside
Progear. From a terminal, `cps2recomp-launcher --play progear` starts it straight away; the game's own program
(`progear`, beside the launcher) runs by itself too: `progear --help` lists what it takes.

## Building from source

With your own ROM set in `rom/progear/` (ignored by Git), from the repository's top:

```sh
make GAME=progear            # twice the first time
make GAME=progear explore    # finds more of the game's code by made-up play, if you want it
make GAME=progear run
make GAME=progear check
```

[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) has what was found of the game; [docs/BUILDING.md](../../docs/BUILDING.md) has every
platform.
