// Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition: names for what is known of the game's memory and routines, each
// found by experiment in this game (PROGRESS.md). The program grew out of Super Street Fighter II Turbo's
// (games/ssf2t): most of its routines are Super Turbo's, moved, with its variables (from A5 = FF8000) moved too. Each
// of Super Turbo's facts was carried over by lining the two programs' code up instruction by instruction (the same
// instruction reading another variable says where that variable went), and then looked at again here. The game's
// own parts (choosing a character's version, the menus between the fights) were traced here. Some facts were first
// named by the FBNeo training script for this game (peon2/fbneo-training-mode, games/hsf2).

// say what is going on: the task does. Slot 0x20 is the show (introduction, title, notices, a demonstration fight,
// rankings; started at 008476), 0x40 the title with credits in (009B52), 0xA0 the game (started at 009D40 when Start

// the one player has lost (continue and game over). In a match the second word is the match's step: 2 and 4 the versus

// 2 while it is fought. Traced with --watch through a one-player game. (Super Turbo has them a word lower: its game's
