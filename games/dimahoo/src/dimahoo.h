// Dimahoo (dimahoou, USA 000121): names for what is known of the game's memory, with how each was found (PROGRESS.md
// has more). The game is Eighting/Raizing's. Its base register A5 holds 928000, inside the board's video memory
// (900000-92FFFF): its variables live there, past the scroll screens and object tables it uses, and the toolkit's Ram8
// and the like reach them by their 68000 address. Work RAM (FF0000 on) holds the ships' and enemies' records. Its code
// is sprinkled with `cmp.w a4,d7 / cmp.w d4,d1 / cmpa.w d5,a3`, which does nothing. The picture is vertical (ROT270).
