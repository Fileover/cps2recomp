// Vampire Savior Definitive: other games' stages, as those games show them (fight/guest_stages.h: their boards run
// beside this one, game.cfg's guests). The first Darkstalkers' (dstlk: its engine is Night Warriors' own, not Vampire
// Savior's, so its stages are not taken in as the characters are) and Street Fighter Alpha 2's; each guest's facts are
// in its own game's folder (games/dstlk/guest.h, games/sfa2/guest.h). Here is what is this game's: its camera, when a
// stage is shown, its objects that are not its stage's, its stage tunes, and which stage is wanted.
//
// Which: a stage chosen by name (training's, the stage viewer's: the guests' after Vampire Savior's twelve), or, with
// the "Darkstalkers' stages" feature, a match's stage is the opponent's own in Darkstalkers, where it has one (player
// 2's in a two-player match; the computer's against it): twelve of the eighteen have.
