# Super Street Fighter II Turbo Recomp

> Part of **[CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md)**: one download and one launcher for every CPS-2 game this
> project has ported. This page is about Super Street Fighter II Turbo; the [main page](../../README.md) says how to
> download and play.

An unofficial native PC port of the arcade game *Super Street Fighter II Turbo* (Capcom, 1994, CPS-2 board; *Super
Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge* in Japan) for macOS, Linux (Steam Deck included) and Windows, made by
static recompilation. It is made from the Japanese 940223 revision, the one Super Turbo is played on in tournaments
and online.

It has everything the other fighting games here have: a full **training mode** (hit boxes, frame data and a frame
meter, input display, combo and stun readouts, a dummy that records, replays and guards), the **alternative modes**
(attract mode, the stage and model viewers, survival, endless battle, ring out), **widescreen**, **custom colours**
with a colour editor, the **hidden characters** with no code (Akuma and the old versions), and the features every
game shares: free play, straight to the title, the board's operator settings, cheats, save states, run-ahead, arcade
timing, a custom soundtrack.

> **Beta.** The game plays from start to ending and its code is checked instruction by instruction, but it has
> been played on few machines and controllers yet. Expect rough edges, and please
> [report what you find](#feedback-and-contributing).

**No game files are included.** You need your own copy of the game: the arcade ROM set `ssf2xjr1` (Japan, 940223)
with its key file, from a board you own. **Only that version works.** This project cannot help you get one.

## What it is

The game's 68000 program is translated ahead of time into C++ and compiled into the port, and so is its sound
CPU's (Capcom's sound driver 1.04). The routines widescreen changes (the camera's place across and up, and keeping the
players inside the picture) are rewritten by hand as readable C++, each checked call by call against the game's own
code. What the program expects of the board (its video, the QSound chip, the sound CPU and its registers, the settings
memory) is code written for this project, not an emulator. Every translated block is checked against an interpreter of
the same program ([how it was made](PROGRESS.md)).

- Plays with a keyboard, a gamepad or an arcade stick; every key and button can be changed, for each player, in the
  launcher. Two more can be given a key or a button: all three punches at once, and all three kicks. In the collection
  it can have a layout of its own, apart from the other games'.
- An in-game menu (Esc or `F1`; on a gamepad, the left stick's click or Start and Select together) with the
  training mode and the other modes, save states, speed, the cheats and every feature.
- **Rapid fire** (Game page): a button held down is pressed again and again, fifteen times a second, for the first
  button or for all of them; the first press is seen at once.
- **Pure** plays exactly as the board does. **Enhanced** (the default) adds free play and your own
  [character colours](#custom-colours). Every other feature is a switch of its own.
- **Free play** is the game's own: a coin mode its test menu never offers, which the feature sets as the board's
  start would. The title says FREE PLAY, and Start goes straight to the character choice.
- **Straight to the title** (Game page): at a start or a reset, everything before the title (the board's start,
  the warning and the introduction) runs unseen; the picture comes back with the title.
- The board's operator settings (difficulty, game speed, continue, demo sound) on the Board page (launcher's Features,
  in-game menu), each as the board is set unless you choose; or the game's own test menu from the in-game menu.
- Cheats: no damage (each player), one-hit knockouts, infinite time.
- **Hidden characters** (Game page): Akuma and each character's old version (as in Super Street Fighter II) with no
  code. Press the three punches at once as you choose a character for Akuma, or any two buttons at once for its old
  version.
- **Arcade timing** (Game page, off unless chosen): the processor run as on the arcade board, so the game slows
  down where and as much as the board does. [More →](../../docs/TIMING.md)
- **Run-ahead** (Game page): what you press seen a frame or two sooner than on the board, with the game running
  exactly as without it.
- **A custom soundtrack**: your own music in place of the board's, with the board's sound effects and voices: a
  folder of music plays as a playlist (in order or shuffled), or files named for the game's songs replace those
  songs. The `songs.txt` the game writes in the soundtrack folder names the music: each stage's tune and its later
  version in a round, the final fight, the introduction and title, player select, versus, the winner's, the ranking,
  Ryu's ending and the staff roll.
  [How →](../../README.md#a-custom-soundtrack)
- Your ROM set is only ever read. Settings, save states and the board's settings memory go in your own user folder.

## Training mode

"Alternative modes" at the top of the in-game menu has a Training mode page: Start goes straight to the character
choice with two players (player 1's controls choose for both) and into a fight with no clock that nobody loses, and
the page holds the aids below.

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Hit boxes | The boxes the game itself tests: where a player can be hit (blue), attacks (red; orange for things thrown), pushing boxes (green) |
| Frame data and frame meter | Startup, active and recovery of each move and the advantage after a hit or a guarded hit, counted in the game's own steps; a row of cells for each player, one a step; optionally every move written to `frame_data.csv` beside the settings |
| Input display | What each player presses and for how long, in numpad notation from the player's side |
| Combo readout | Hits and damage of a combo, the round's best |
| Stun readout | How much stun each player has built up, against how much stuns them (more each time they have been stunned) |
| Health and gauge refills | Health comes back when a player has not been hit for a moment; both super combo gauges kept full |
| The dummy | Stands, crouches, jumps; guards (always, after a hit, at random); records and replays in three slots (one, or any at random), and can answer with a recording after guarding or being hit |
| Start over | The round as it began, in the middle or a corner, sides swapped or not (Backspace, or a gamepad's left shoulder) |
| Stage | Any of the sixteen stages, or the game's own choice |
| Stop, step, slow | Stop the game, go on a frame at a time, or play at a half, a quarter or an eighth of the speed |

## Alternative modes

The in-game menu's first row, "Alternative modes", has ways of playing and watching the game that the board does not
have. Each has a page with a Start row and its own choices, and runs until another is started or the menu's Reset.

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Training mode | A fight with no clock that nobody loses, and the aids above |
| Attract mode | The game's own show on a loop: everything, the introduction and the title only, or the demonstration fight over and over |
| Stage viewer | Any of the sixteen stages with nobody on it and no panel, scrolled with the stick or by itself, with any tune; "Infinite" scrolls through every stage in turn |
| Model viewer | One character by itself, on a stage or on plain white or black, from a quarter of its size to 25 times. It stands and moves with your controls, or goes through any of its animations (named A0, A12... as the game's own list numbers them; left and right step through them), over and over or all of them one after another (Play all), at full speed or in slow motion |
| Colour editor | Change a character's colours while you watch: [custom colours](#custom-colours) |
| Survival | One computer opponent after another on the health you have left. How many can you beat? |
| Endless battle | Two fighters the game plays, for as long as you like, with no clock, on one stage, on stages that fade one into another, or on a floor that scrolls through them all. Touch the controls to take a fighter over |
| Ring out | No knock-outs. Knock your opponent over the end of the stage (it is flung into the air and falls through the floor), then jump down after it and land on the next stage |

## Widescreen

![Widescreen: Ryu and Ken in Las Vegas (Balrog's stage), more of the stage on each side](../../docs/screenshots/ssf2t/widescreen.png)

A switch on the launcher's first page, under "Full screen" (and on the in-game menu's Display page). Fights are shown
and played in 16:9: the picture is 512 columns wide where the board's is 384, at the same height and with everything
the same size, so there is a third more of the stage in view.

It is **off unless you switch it on**, in every preset, because it changes how the game plays:

- The players can go to the wide picture's edges, so they can stand further apart than on the board. The stage's own
  ends are where they were.
- The camera stops 64 short of where it did, so that the picture ends where the stage does.
- The bars and the gauges stay in the middle. Everything that is not a fight keeps the board's 4:3.

With it off the game is exactly the board's.

**Invisible walls**, on the Display page, keeps the 16:9 picture and plays the game exactly as the board does: the
players are stopped where the board's picture ends, by walls that are not seen, and the camera goes as far as the
board's. Near a stage's end the view stays on the stage, so the play area is then to one side of the wide picture. The
game's memory is the same as with widescreen off, frame for frame (`make GAME=ssf2t check-widescreen` compares it along
the ladder).

## Custom colours

Give any character colours of your own: change them in the game's colour editor (Alternative modes), or bring files
someone else made.

- **The colour editor** shows the character with a panel at the right, worked with player 1's controls: the
  character, background, size and animation; the **set** (by what chooses the character: each of the six buttons,
  Start, a button held, and the old version's two); the **line** (one of the set's five palettes); each colour's red,
  green and blue; random colours; saving a set to the character's library and loading it into any set. Changes show
  at once and are saved as you go. To play in them, choose the character the way of the set you changed.
- **Files**: `palettes/<Character>.txt` in the game's data folder (one section a set, a line of 16 colours a
  palette), or a `sfxj.04a` changed with PalMod. "Write the game's colours" writes the game's own to start from.

## The board's settings

The Board page has the settings of the test menu's System Configuration that change the game, each "As the board is
set" unless chosen. A choice is what the test menu would have set; the board's settings memory itself is not changed,
and the test menu shows the board's own values.

| Setting | Choices | The board's own (a new board) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Difficulty | 1 (easiest) to 8 (hardest) | 4 (medium) |
| Game speed | Turbo 1 to 4, Free select | Turbo 2 |
| Continue | Off, On | On |
| Demo sound | Off, On | Off |

## What you need

- The ROM set `ssf2xjr1` (*Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge*, Japan 940223): `ssf2xjr1.zip` or a
  folder with the set's files, including `ssf2xj.key`. The launcher checks every file by checksum and tells you which
  is missing or different. Sets of other regions and revisions are refused: the port is made from this one version's
  program, and its features use addresses found in it.
- One of: macOS 13 or later (Apple silicon or Intel); Linux x86_64 or SteamOS; Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- A gamepad or stick with six buttons is recommended.

## Playing

Super Street Fighter II Turbo comes with [CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md#playing): open its launcher and show it your
ROM set (drop `ssf2xjr1.zip` or its folder on the window, or choose the folder you keep your sets in), then press
**Play** beside Super Street Fighter II Turbo. From a terminal, `cps2recomp-launcher --play ssf2t` starts it straight
away; the game's own program (`ssf2t`, beside the launcher) runs by itself too: `ssf2t --help` lists what it takes.

While playing, Esc or `F1` (on a gamepad, the left stick's click, or Start and Select together) opens the in-game
menu. Only the menu's "Quit game" row (or closing the window) ends the game.

## Building from source

With your own ROM set in `rom/ssf2t/` (ignored by Git), CMake, Ninja, SDL 3 and Python 3,
from the repository's top:

```sh
make GAME=ssf2t            # twice the first time
make GAME=ssf2t explore    # once, about ten minutes: finds the game's code by made-up play and translates it
make GAME=ssf2t run
make GAME=ssf2t check FRAMES=40000 MOVIE=games/ssf2t/movies/ladder.txt ARGS="--features free_play,no_damage,one_hit"
```

[docs/BUILDING.md](../../docs/BUILDING.md) has every platform, the checks and the release builds, and
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) what was found about the game and what is next.
