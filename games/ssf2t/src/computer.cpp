// Super Street Fighter II Turbo: a player handed to the game's computer in the middle of a round (the fighting modes:
// fight/battle.h, which say who plays a fighter each frame by its byte kPerson).
//
// A player's routine (078030) runs a person's step (078270) or the computer's (07BB22) by that byte, and both keep how
// far on they are in the record's kFighting byte: 0 at a round's start, then 2 for the fight. The computer's first
// step (07BB34) sets up what the computer plays by (its tables for the character and the plan it follows: 07D6F4,
// 07E36E, 07BB82, the two words from 24EAE8), which a person's never does; a player handed over at 2 goes straight to
// the computer's fight step with none of it, and the computer's code reads its plan from nowhere (the game stops). So
// where the computer's step is about to run (07804A) for a player with no plan in its record (the long kPlanTable: the
// record is cleared as a match begins, 003616, and only the computer's set-up writes it, 07E3A8), the game is sent
// through that set-up first (07D6F4, 07E36E, 07BB82, the two words from 24EAE8; not its tables from 005078 nor its
// shadow, which the player has, nor the standing animation it starts). In the game itself a player only changes hands between rounds, at 0: this never runs.
