// Super Street Fighter II Turbo: swapping a player's fighter in the middle of a fight, for the team battle's tag style
// (fight/battle.h), as Street Fighter Alpha 2's livetag.cpp does it. The game sets a player up again itself: its
// routine's step 0 (kFighting 0: 078282 a person's, 07BB34 the computer's) takes the character's tables (005078: its
// boxes, its sizes, and an object of its own for E. Honda and two for Dee Jay) and makes its shadow (00503C), and the
// computer's sets up its plan too. So a swap is the character's bytes, its colours and the steps put at 0; the game
// does the rest at its next step, where the player is. The objects the old character's setting up made (its shadow,
// E. Honda's, Dee Jay's) are given back to their pool first, as the game gives one back (003794), or there would be two
// shadows and another character's own object left running. The colours are put in on the next frame, as the round's
// start puts them (0BFA78).
//
// A hit that empties the bar of a fighter with a partner left is made a knock-down (a sweep's kind, 0E: cheats.cpp asks
// TagKnockDown where the damage is taken), and the one knocked out lies until the next comes in, not to be hit.
//
// For tests, SSF2T_SWAP=FRAME:PLAYER:CHARACTER,... (hex character) swaps outside the team battle, at that frame or, with
// SSF2T_SWAP_FREE, as soon after as the player can act.
