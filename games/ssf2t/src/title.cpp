// Super Street Fighter II Turbo: "Straight to the title" (the Game page), as in the other games. When the board
// starts (switched on, or reset from the menu), everything before the title is run unseen and unheard, as fast as it
// goes: the board's memory test, the warning and the introduction. The picture comes back with the title; nothing of
// the game is changed, only not shown.
//
// The game's step (ssf2t.h, kMode) goes 2 to 10 in twos while the board starts (the warning at 4 and 6, frames 108-
// 302), then 0 (frame 805) and into the loop of its show: 2 the introduction, whose own step (kGameStep) is 16 when the
// title comes in from white (frame 2229: "SUPER", then the rest of it), 4 to 16 the notices, a demonstration fight
// and the rankings. With a coin in it goes from the introduction to 4 instead: the title that asks for Start. The
// board's start and its show share their numbers, so the start's last step (10) is waited for first. Only the board's
// start begins it (Machine::frame is 0 again at a reset): the step is 0 for a few frames between the screens of a
// game too.
