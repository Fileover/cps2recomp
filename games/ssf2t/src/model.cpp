// Super Street Fighter II Turbo: the model viewer (the toolkit's model/model.h), a mode of the menu's "Alternative
// modes" page: one character alone, on a stage or on plain white or black, at any size, standing as it does in a fight
// (and moved with player 1's controls), or going through any one of its animations.
//
// It is a round of a two-player match, reached unseen as the stage viewer's is (fight/alternative.h), with the second
// player put out of the way: the camera kept on the first, and the second never drawn.
//
// A character's animations: each character has a routine of its own that starts one (the tables at 100000, 100088 and
// 100110 name them by the character's number, 16 Akuma's and 17 on the old versions'; the three ways in differ only in
// which of an animation's variants they take). In every one the list of its animations is 0x34 on from where it
// begins, a word an animation (read relative to the routine: the deciphered program), its first word saying how many;
// each names a short list of the animation's variants by the way the player faces, and each of those its first frame
// (read through A0: the data view). A frame is 0x18 bytes, as in the Alpha games: a word of how many frames of the game
// it is shown for, a word whose top bit says the next is a jump (to the frame the long after this one names), where
// its picture is, and the numbers of its boxes. Showing one is putting its frame in the player's record each frame, as
// the game's own 002ED0 does, with the time left kept high so that the game's own stepping (002EE2) never comes round;
// the game goes on believing the player stands.
