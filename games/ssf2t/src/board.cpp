// starts (00823A, called at 008FF6), into the variables below; the hook at 008FFC, where that call returns, puts the
// choices in those variables. The board's settings memory itself is not changed, nor what the test menu shows and
// saves.

// The settings record (A5-6578, as the settings memory holds it) and the variable each goes to (from A5; 00831C on
// copies them):
//   +1E game speed  3A9  0 turbo 1, 1 turbo 2, 2 turbo 3, 3 turbo 4, 4 free select (turbo 2)
//   +20 difficulty  2D3  0 to 7: 1 (easiest) to 8 (hardest) (4, medium)
//   +23 demo sound  2DD  0 off, 1 on (off)
//   +24 continue    2DA  0 off, 1 on (on)
//   +26 start mode  344  0 off, 1 on (off)

// step; in brackets the value the test menu shows as the board's own on a new board)
