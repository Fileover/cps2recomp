# Vampire Savior 2 Recomp

> Part of **[CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md)**: one download and one launcher for every CPS-2 game this
> project has ported. This page is about Vampire Savior 2; the [main page](../../README.md) says how to
> download and play.

An unofficial native PC port of the arcade game *Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire* (Capcom, 1997, CPS-2
board, Japan only) for macOS, Linux (Steam Deck included) and Windows, made by static recompilation, with a full
training mode.

Vampire Savior 2 is Vampire Savior with **Donovan, Phobos (Huitzil) and Pyron** back from Night Warriors, in place
of Gallon, Aulbath and Sasquatch, and a thirteenth stage. It came out only in Japanese arcades, beside
[Vampire Hunter 2](../vhunt2/README.md), and was made from Vampire Savior's program: this port builds the same
sources as the [Vampire Savior port](../vampire_savior/README.md), so it has everything that one has.

> **Beta.** The game plays and its code is checked instruction by instruction, but nobody has played it by hand
> yet. Expect rough edges, and please [report what you find](#feedback-and-contributing).

**No game files are included.** You need your own copy of the game: the arcade ROM set `vsav2` (Japan, 970913)
with its key file, from a board you own. This project cannot help you get one.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Capcom. *Vampire Savior* and *Darkstalkers* are
trademarks of Capcom Co., Ltd.

## What it is

The game's 68000 program is translated ahead of time into C++ and compiled into the port. The routines that
features touch (the camera, the stages, hit tests, the fight's rules) are Vampire Savior's readable rewrites, run
here where this game has them, with this game's own rules where they differ, and each is checked against this
game's own code on every call ([how it works](PROGRESS.md)). What the program expects of the board is code written
for this project, not an emulator.

- Plays with a keyboard, a gamepad or an arcade stick; every key and button can be changed, for each player, in the
  launcher. Two more can be given a key or a button: all three punches at once, and all three kicks. In the collection
  it can have a layout of its own, apart from the other games'.
- An in-game menu (Esc or `F1`; on a gamepad, the left stick's click or Start and Select together)
  with the training mode and the other modes, save states, speed (1/8 to 8x), the cheats,
  every feature, and a Reset all options row.
- The picture your way (Display page): sharp, whole pixels or smooth; 4:3, square pixels or the
  whole screen; and the window's size.
- **Zoom**: hold the left stick's click and press the left shoulder to zoom in on player 1's fighter, the right
  shoulder for player 2's (keyboard: hold Left Shift and press Q or E). Each press for the same player goes a size
  up, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x and 2x (the model viewer's sizes: at 2x the top of a tall fighter is off the screen), then
  back to the whole picture; a press for the other player looks at that one instead. The fighter is kept in the
  middle all the while (past the stage's ends is black); with the click (or Left Shift) still held, the d-pad or
  the stick (the arrows) moves the camera to frame it as you like, until the zoom is off or looks at the other fighter. The size eases from one
  to the next, it is said at the bottom for a few seconds, and outside a fight the picture is whole again. The
  game's own health bars are zoomed with it; the port's own text (a mode's score, the training display) is not.
  With the left stick's click held, the right stick's click (keyboard: Left Shift and W) keeps **both fighters** in
  the picture instead: the camera as close as shows both whole, tight when they are close and wide when they are
  apart (2x at most, the whole picture at least), kept inside the stage; again for the whole picture. The left
  stick's click alone still opens the menu, when it is let go.
- **Rapid fire** (Game page): a button held down is pressed again and again, fifteen times a second, for the first
  button or for all of them; the first press is seen at once.
- **Pure** plays exactly as the board does. **Enhanced** (the default) adds free play and your own
  character colours. Every other feature is a switch of its own.
- The board's operator settings (difficulty, attack power, timer speed, game speed and the rest) on
  the Board page, each as the board is set unless you choose; or the game's own test menu from the in-game menu.
- **A custom soundtrack**: your own music in place of the board's, with the board's sound effects and voices: a
  folder of music plays as a playlist (in order or shuffled), or files named for the game's songs replace those
  songs (the `songs.txt` the game writes names its 48 pieces: each stage's, each character's win, the rival, Jedah,
  the ending). [How →](../../docs/SOUNDTRACK.md)
- Your ROM set is only ever read. Settings, save states and the board's settings memory go in your own user folder, or beside the launcher in [portable mode](../../docs/LAUNCHER.md#portable-mode).

## The characters and stages

Fifteen characters: Bulleta, Demitri, Victor, Zabel, Morrigan, Anakaris, Felicia, Bishamon, Q-Bee, Lei-Lei, Lilith,
Jedah, **Phobos, Pyron and Donovan**. Hidden on the board: Oboro Bishamon (Bishamon chosen with Start held), Shadow
(Start five times on the "?" box), Marionette (seven times), and another way of Phobos and of Donovan (Start held as
they are chosen). The **Hidden characters** switch (Game page) gives Oboro Bishamon for Bishamon and Shadow for the
"?" box without their codes, for player 1, player 2 or both, and to the alternative modes' fighters too.

Thirteen stages: Vampire Savior's twelve and **Donovan's**, Feast of the Damned's hall empty and darker, with its
own tune. Every stage is in the training mode's stage choice, the stage viewer and the modes.

## Training mode

"Alternative modes" at the top of the in-game menu has a Training mode page: Start goes straight
to the character choice with two players and into a fight with no clock that nobody loses, and
the page holds the aids below.

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Hit boxes | The boxes the game itself tests: where a player can be hit (blue), attacks (red; orange for things thrown), and the boxes that keep the players apart (green) |
| Frame data and frame meter | Startup, active and recovery of each move and the advantage after a hit or a guarded hit, counted in the game's own steps; a row of coloured cells for each player, one a step |
| Input display | What each player presses and for how long, the stick as a keypad number |
| Combo readout | Hits, damage, how much is lost for good and how much comes back, the round's best |
| Health refills | A player's health comes back when they have not been hit for a moment |
| The dummy | Stands, crouches, jumps; guards (always, after a hit, at random; high or low as each attack needs); pushes away or guard cancels; softens throws; gets up where it fell or rolls towards or away; records and replays in three slots (one, or any at random), and can answer with a recording after guarding or being hit |
| Start over | The round as it began, in the middle or a corner, sides swapped or not (Backspace, or a gamepad's left shoulder) |
| Stage | Any of the thirteen stages, or the game's own choice |
| Stop, step, slow | Stop the game, go on one frame at a time, or play at a half, a quarter or an eighth of the speed (anywhere, not only in training) |

Also: save states in nine slots, free play, and a few cheats (no damage, one-hit knockouts, full
gauge, infinite time).

## Alternative modes

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Training mode | A fight with no clock that nobody loses, and the aids above |
| Attract mode | The game's own show on a loop, as a cabinet left alone plays it, with no coin to keep out |
| Stage viewer | Any of the thirteen stages with nobody on it and no panel, its own pieces moving and its music playing (or another stage's). Scroll it with the stick, or let it drift from end to end. "Infinite" is all thirteen in turn, each scrolling into the next |
| Model viewer | One character by itself, on a stage or on plain white or black, from a quarter of its size to 25 times, standing and moving with your controls or going through any of its animations, at full speed or in slow motion |
| Survival | One opponent after another on the health you have left. How many can you beat? |
| Endless battle | Two fighters the game plays, for as long as you like, with no bars and no clock, on one stage, on stages that fade one into another, or on a floor that scrolls through them all. Touch the controls to take a fighter over |
| Ring out | No health. Knock your opponent over the end of the stage (it is thrown back, as by a knock-down, and falls through the floor), then jump down after it and land on the next stage. The CPU plays it as a ring out, not for damage, and guards as it always does: it walks you towards an end, throws or sweeps you when your back is to it, and keeps off its own end, getting out of a corner with a throw that swaps sides or a jump over you |
| Tag team battle | Two teams of two or three, chosen on its page: one fighter of each team at a time, all on one stage, each on one health bar (a team of two has two bars between them, as one fighter has in a usual match), or as many as the board gives. The one knocked down is out and the next of that team comes on with a full bar; the winner stays on with the health it has left. Team 2 is the CPU (its difficulty chosen on the page), or player 2. Fighters begin ready, with no entrances, and the same character twice in a match (on either team) is never in the same colours. With "Tag team" on the same page, each fighter is a person's own: co-op (players 1 and 2 against the computer's team) or 2 vs 2 for four players, a label under the bars saying who is on. **Tag style**, the default ("Style: Knock-out" for the one-at-a-time style above): Marvel-style, each fighter keeps a bar of its own and you tag the next one in with a gamepad's left trigger (or Start) whenever yours can act: yours calls the next one in and flies off the screen, and the next one jumps in from that side with a jump attack that can hit. When a bar empties, that fighter is knocked down (the announcer's call with it) and lies there for two seconds, not to be hit (time for a setup), and the next one jumps in, resting fighters get back the health that comes back by itself, the team's super gauges carry over, the others' health is listed under the bars, and a time over goes to the team with more health in all. The CPU's team tags too, as a person would: when the one on is low and a partner has more (or has rested), while you are down or far off, or after backing away from you first, never in the middle of your combo, and more or less often by its difficulty. In co-op and 2 vs 2 the partner tags in with their own left trigger |
| Colour editor | Change a character's colours while you watch: custom colours, below |

## Widescreen

A switch on the launcher's first page, under "Full screen" (and on the in-game menu's Display page). Fights are
shown and played in 16:9: the picture is 512 columns wide where the board's is 384, at the same height and with
everything the same size, so there is a third more of the stage in view. Off unless you switch it on, because it
changes how the game plays (the players can stand further apart; the camera stops 64 short of where it did; a
stage's pieces and things thrown are kept while they are in the wide picture). The bars, the clock and the gauges
stay in the middle; the modes are wide too; everything that is not a fight keeps the board's 4:3.

**Invisible walls** (Display page) keeps the 16:9 picture and plays the game exactly as the board does: the players
are stopped where the board's picture ends, by walls that are not seen.

## Custom colours

Give any character colours of your own, with the game's colour editor (on the in-game menu's "Alternative modes"
page: the character in front of you, any of their ten colour sets, 16 levels each of red, green and blue, random
colours, a library of saved sets) or with [PalMod](https://github.com/Preppy/PalMod): edit a copy of your set's
`vs2j.10` with it (never the one in your ROM set) and put the copy in the `palettes` folder. To play in them, choose
the character with the button of the set you changed. It works as in Vampire Savior, whose page has the
[whole story](../vampire_savior/README.md#custom-colours); the folder is:

| System | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Vampire Savior 2\palettes` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Vampire Savior 2/palettes` |
| Linux, SteamOS | `~/.local/share/Vampire Savior 2/palettes` |
| [Portable mode](../../docs/LAUNCHER.md#portable-mode) | `user/Vampire Savior 2/palettes` beside the launcher |

## What you need

- The ROM set `vsav2` (*Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire*, Japan 970913): `vsav2.zip` or a folder with the
  set's files, including `vsav2.key`. The launcher checks every file by checksum and tells you which is missing or
  different.
- One of: macOS 13 or later (Apple silicon or Intel); Linux x86_64 or SteamOS; Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- A gamepad or stick with six buttons is recommended.

## Playing

Vampire Savior 2 comes with [CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md#getting-started): open its launcher and show it your ROM set
(drop `vsav2.zip` or its folder on the window, or choose the folder you keep your sets in), then press **Play**
beside Vampire Savior 2. From a terminal, `cps2recomp-launcher --play vsav2` starts it straight away; the game's own
program (`vsav2`, beside the launcher) runs by itself too: `vsav2 --help` lists what it takes.

## Building from source

With your own ROM set in `rom/vsav2/` (ignored by Git), from the repository's top:

```sh
make GAME=vsav2            # twice the first time
make GAME=vsav2 explore    # once: finds the game's code by made-up play and translates it
make GAME=vsav2 run
make GAME=vsav2 check-rewrites check-widescreen
```

The sources are Vampire Savior's (`games/vampire_savior/src`); `family.h` here says where their places are in this
game and what is its own, and [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) what was found. [docs/BUILDING.md](../../docs/BUILDING.md)
has every platform.
