// Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter: the training session is the toolkit's (fight/session.h); this says where the game keeps
// what it needs. What the players do (each player's step of a fight, for the frame data; a hit landing; the boxes as
// the game's hit tests read them) is told from the game's own code by the engine's shared code (fight/marvel.h), at
// the character's step (00BE56, once a step for each of the four, the point characters first of their sides). A
// side's two characters take turns in the first two records (a tag or a knockout swaps the records: mshvsf.h), so the
// session follows the character on point; the one resting is looked after here (its health refilled with the point
// character's).
