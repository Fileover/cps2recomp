# Street Fighter II: Champion Edition Recomp

> Part of **[CPS-2 Recomp](../../README.md)**: one download and one launcher for every Capcom arcade game this
> project has ported. This page is about Street Fighter II: Champion Edition; the [main page](../../README.md) says how
> to download and play.

An unofficial native PC port of the arcade game *Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition* (Capcom, 1992, CPS-1 board)
for macOS, Linux (Steam Deck included) and Windows, made by static recompilation.

Champion Edition made the four bosses playable and let both players choose the same character. Super Street Fighter II
Turbo's program grew out of this one, and this port builds the same sources as the
[Super Street Fighter II Turbo port](../ssf2t/README.md), with this game's own places and board, so it has what that
one has but what Super Turbo added to the game (super combos, the hidden characters, the speeds).

It has a full **training mode** (hit boxes, frame data and a frame meter, input display, combo and stun readouts, a
dummy that records, replays and guards), the **alternative modes** (attract mode, the stage and model viewers,
survival, endless battle, ring out, a tag team battle), **widescreen**, **custom colours** with a colour editor, and
the features every game shares: free play, straight to the title, the board's DIP switches, cheats, save states,
run-ahead, arcade timing, a custom soundtrack.

> **Beta.** The game plays from start to ending and its code is checked instruction by instruction, but nobody has
> played it by hand yet. Expect rough edges, and please [report what you find](#feedback-and-contributing).

**No game files are included.** You need your own copy of the game: the arcade ROM set `sf2ce` (World, 920513), from
a board you own. This project cannot help you get one.

## What it is

The game's 68000 program is translated ahead of time into C++ and compiled into the port, and so is its sound CPU's.
The board is the toolkit's classic CPS-1 (no QSound): the Z80 drives a YM2151 ([ymfm](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm))
and an OKI MSM6295 (`sound/okim6295.cpp`). Everything the port adds is Super Turbo's sources, which name the places they
use in Super Turbo's program; this game's `family.h` says where each is here ([how it was made](PROGRESS.md)).

Training mode, the alternative modes, widescreen and its invisible walls, the colour editor, the zoom, the in-game menu
and the rest work as on the [Super Turbo page](../ssf2t/README.md), with these differences:

- No super combo gauge, no hidden characters (all twelve are on the select screen), no game speed.
- **Free play** is the board's own DIP switch, set by the feature.
- **The Board page** is the board's DIP switches: difficulty, continue, demo sound, two coins to start.
- **Custom colours**: each character has two sets, its own (Normal) and the one it has when both players choose it
  (Other), of one palette. PalMod's file for it is `s92_22b.7f`.
- **A custom soundtrack**: on the classic board too. [The list of its songs](../../docs/SONGS.md#street-fighter-ii-champion-edition)
  names the music. A replaced tune stops the board's sound effects for a moment as it starts (the classic sound program
  has no command that stops only its music). [How →](../../docs/SOUNDTRACK.md)

## What you need

- The ROM set `sf2ce` (*Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition*, World 920513): `sf2ce.zip` or a folder with its files.
  A merged zip with its clones in it works too: the launcher finds each file by checksum. Other regions and revisions
  are refused.
- One of: macOS 13 or later; Linux x86_64 or SteamOS; Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- A gamepad or stick with six buttons is recommended.

## Building from source

With your own ROM sets in `rom/sf2ce/` and `rom/ssf2t/` (ignored by Git; Super Turbo's is needed only to make
`family.h` again), CMake, Ninja, SDL 3 and Python 3, from the repository's top:

```sh
make GAME=sf2ce            # twice the first time
make GAME=sf2ce explore    # once: finds the game's code by made-up play and translates it
make GAME=sf2ce run
make GAME=sf2ce check FRAMES=52000 MOVIE=games/sf2ce/movies/ladder.txt ARGS="--features free_play,no_damage,one_hit"
```

[docs/BUILDING.md](../../docs/BUILDING.md) has every platform, the checks and the release builds, and
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) what was found about the game and what is next.
