// Night Warriors: the model viewer (the toolkit's model/model.h), a mode of the menu's "Alternative modes" page: one
// character alone, on a stage or on plain white or black, at any size, standing as it does in a fight (and moved with
// player 1's controls), or going through any one of its animations. As Pocket Fighter's.
//
// It is a round of a two-player match, reached unseen as the stage viewer's is (fight/alternative.h), with the second
// player put out of the way: the camera follows player 1 alone (0FF6D6, where it takes the two players' places), the
// second stands far off and is never drawn.
//
// A character's animations are in lists (006B02: its table of them, a long a list, from the table at 006B70 by the
// character's number, kept at +1C8; 0051B8 starts one: the list's word of how far on the animation is, by its number).
// The lists follow their table, so it is as long as the gap to the first. An animation is frames of 0x20 bytes: a word
// of how many frames of the game it is shown for (the low 13 bits), whose top bit says what follows it (with the next
// bit too: nothing, it stays; else a jump, to the frame the long 0x20 on names; 005344), a word to +26, the long of its
// picture (to +2C), and the numbers of its boxes (+10 on). Showing one is putting its frame in the player's record each
// frame, as 005364 does, with the time left kept high so that the game's own stepping never comes round.
