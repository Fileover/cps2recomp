// in bands where the game wrote its maps or the palette while the board drew; the objects as instanced tiles, the front
// one at each pixel kept by depth; the colours, with each object's level against the screens' pens. With the CPU's
// rasteriser (video/native_render.h) as the reference: --video gpu-check draws each frame here too, reads it back and
// compares it with the board's lines.
//
// So far: the board's picture and what a game's sources set on it (a wider picture, its screens and objects moved, tiles
// given beyond the board's columns, holes filled, objects hidden), with the objects' offsets the same on every line; not
// the marks of pictures put together from two, nor layers left out. Other frames are not drawn here and are counted.
