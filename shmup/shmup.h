// A shoot-'em-up's "Alternative modes" page and its practice mode, for every shooting game on the board (Giga Wing the
// first, then Progear; 19XX and 1944 would describe themselves the same way). Each is started by a command of the in-game
// menu and ends when the board is reset, when another is started, or as said below.
//
//   Practice       a stage, or straight at its boss, with the fighter, ships, bombs and power chosen. Backspace (a
//                  gamepad's left shoulder) puts it back as it began, at once: the start is kept as a save state in
//                  memory when it is first reached. Replay shows the last attempt again, from that start, with the
//                  controls as they were pressed. The practice aids (the ships' true hit boxes, the enemies' shots, a
//                  readout of the scoring, a summary at each boss and stage end) work only in practice.
//   Attract mode   the game's own show on a loop, with no coin in and its sound on, or one part of it.
//   Score attack   one player, one credit, no continue and no cheats, from the first stage: the board's own game, for
//                  the best score, which is kept (shmup_scores.txt beside settings.ini).
//   Caravan        two, three or five minutes from the first stage, as many ships as it takes: the best score in the
//                  time is kept for each length.
//   Boss rush      each boss in turn: the way between them is run unseen, the ships out of harm. The best score is
//                  kept, and the time it took.
//   Stage viewer   a stage scrolling by with nobody on it: no ships, no enemies, no shots, no panel.
//
// A game's sources describe how it is got into and what it keeps where (Description), register it, and ask while the
// game runs: the stage a game is to start at, whether the ships are to be out of harm (Protected), whether their own
// choices are left out.
