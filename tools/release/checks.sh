# A release's checks (docs/RELEASING.md, step 1): for every game (games/*, or GAMES="a b"), with its ROM set in
# rom/<id>/: its build, check, check-blocks, check-release over its ladder movie if it has one (40,000 frames;
# Puzzle Fighter's 66,000), check-rewrites and check-widescreen if it has them; then the repository's make check.
# A game's steps one after another (two builds of one game must never run together), JOBS games at once (3: a
# check-rewrites runs several of its own at once too; each game has its build/<id>/ and work/<id>/). Each step's
# output is in build/release-checks/; a line for each step as it ends, and at the end the ones that failed. About
# 40 minutes on a ten-core Mac (one game at a time, 73).
#   tools/release/checks.sh            JOBS=1 tools/release/checks.sh: one game at a time
#
# Every game's code must have been found first (work/<id>/entries.txt: make GAME=<id> explore, or
# tools/seed_entries.sh from a tree where it was): a tree without it translates from guesses, and check and
# check-blocks fail for that alone. The checks stop at once if a game has none.
