# Release build for Android (ARM64, Android 9 and later): build/release/CPS2Recomp-android.apk, one app with the
# launcher and every game. Each game is a library (lib<id>.so) that the app starts in a process of its own
# (android/: GameActivity.java); the launcher is recomp-common's, as a library too. Needs the translated code of
# a build of each game with its ROM set (lib.sh), CMake and Ninja, a JDK 17 and the Android SDK with platform 34,
# build-tools and NDK 27.2 (ANDROID_HOME; Homebrew's android-commandlinetools is found on its own: brew install
# openjdk@17 android-commandlinetools). SDL 3 is built from source (its Java half is compiled into the app).
#
#   ROM_SETS=<folder> tools/release/android.sh
#       a development build with your own ROM sets packed in (the folder's zips), to try on your own phone: the
#       app copies them into its folder the first time it opens, set up for every game. Never share that APK.
#
# Signing: with KEYSTORE, KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KEY_ALIAS and KEY_PASSWORD the APK is signed with that key. They are
# also read from the file SIGNING names (default ~/.config/cps2recomp/android-signing.env, outside the
# repository), as lines of NAME="value". Without either it is signed with the Android debug key, which is fine for
# sideloading your own build; RELEASE=1 refuses that, because a published APK has to carry the same key every time
# or it won't install over the one before.
