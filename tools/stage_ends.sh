# Where each stage's art ends, against where the wide picture's camera stops (tools/stage_ends.py says how). For every
# stage a training session is started (the game's movies/corners.txt up to its first walk), and the players are put in
# the left corner and the right corner in turn by "Start over", player 1 jumping now and then (for the lines above);
# once with the board's picture and once with widescreen. Run from the repository's top:
#
#   tools/stage_ends.sh GAME STAGES CAMERA [DIR]
#
# STAGES: how many; CAMERA: the camera's place across, a word of work RAM (hex, as the game's names have it), or one
# for each stage, with commas between (where the camera's record is the stage's own: the Marvel games). Prints
# tools/stage_ends.py's lines for each stage, and exits 1 if the wide picture went past a stage's art anywhere. The
# logs are left in DIR if given (else a folder that is removed). B, ROM, CORNERS (another game's corners movie, for a
# game built from its sources), START (the ticks the session's stage is chosen and it is started; 3,5), FEATURES (more
# features for both runs:
# widescreen_walls for invisible walls), LAYERS (the scroll screens looked at, as 1,2,3), REACH (tools/stage_ends.py's
# --reach), JOBS, ONLY (the stages to look at, as "3 7"); QUIET=1 says only the
# stages that went past their art.
