# Where a stage's art ends, on each scroll screen, and how much nearer the middle a wide picture's camera must stop so
# that the picture never shows past it. Reads two --layer-log files of the same stage (port/main.cpp), each with the
# players put in the left corner and in the right corner in turn (training's "Start over"): one of the board's picture,
# one of the wide picture played in (the camera stopping `margin` short of each end).
#
# "The art" of a scroll screen is what the board itself shows of it: on each line of its map, the columns from its place
# with the camera at its left end to its place at the right end and the 384 beyond. Past that the map holds either
# nothing (a gap) or art the board never shows. A scroll screen that moves slower than the camera (a far background:
# Street Fighter Alpha's third goes at half its speed) is where the wide picture first goes past it, so the camera must
# stop further in for it: by what it went past, over its speed.
#
#   tools/stage_ends.py BOARD WIDE [--from FRAME] [--layers 2,3] [--reach MOST:2]
#
# --reach: the camera stops at most MOST further in than the wide picture's margin for the scroll screens named (the
# stage's own plane): their lines that would need more (the far edge of a perspective floor, near its horizon) are not
# looked at.
# Only what is seen counts: a screen behind another's painted pixels may go past its art unseen. Lines of a screen
# that the board shows less of than the wide picture's width (a far plane that barely moves) are left out: no camera
# can keep the wide picture inside those.
#
# Prints, for each scroll screen, how far the wide picture went past its art at each end, and the camera's ends that
# would keep it in; the last line is "ends LEFT RIGHT" (how much nearer the middle than the board's, at each end, for
# all the screens), and the exit status is 1 if the wide picture went past the art at all.
