// Other games' stages behind a fighting game's fighters, as those games show them. Each other game ("a guest") is a
// board of its own run beside the game's (runtime/guest.h; game.cfg's guests), held in a two-player match on the
// stage, its fighters left standing and never drawn, its clock held, its camera put where the game's is every frame.
// The picture is the guest's stage with the game's fighters and panel over it (drawn alone, marked:
// Video::markObjects); the music is the guest stage's own, in place of the game's stage tune (Soundtrack::Take), with
// the game's fades.
//
// A guest that says where its main loop is (Guest::StageAlone, Vampire Savior's) runs its stage alone: no match, its
// stage's own code only (below). For the others, each stage's round is made once, on a spare board of the guest
// (GuestSpare) and a thread of its own, from the
// program's start: the board played with made-up controls (credits, both Starts, a punch at each screen that waits for
// one) into a two-player match on the stage, to the round. That is the same board, frame for frame, every time, so a
// match on a stage always starts from it, however long ago it was made: the same in a run played straight, its frames
// run again (online play's rollback), a save state loaded or the other player's game. A match that wants a round not
// made yet waits for it. The guest's board is kept with the game's state.
//
// What a game says of itself (Host) and of each guest (Guest) is all of it: a guest is described once, by the facts
// its own port found (its steps, its credits, where it sets a match's stage, its clock, its stage's objects, its
// camera), and can then be shown by any game. Vampire Savior Definitive shows Darkstalkers' and Street Fighter Alpha
// 2's (games/vsav_definitive/src/stages.cpp); Alpha 2 and Zero 2 Alpha show Darkstalkers' and Vampire Savior's
// (games/sfa2/src/stages.cpp). The guests' facts: games/dstlk/guest.h, games/sfa2/guest.h, games/vampire_savior/guest.h.
