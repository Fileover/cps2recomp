// The engine of Capcom's Marvel fighting games on the board: Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel
// Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter (each made from the one before: tools/portmap.py places much of its code in the
// other), and their kin. Their players' records, cameras, boxes and animations work alike, at other places and offsets
// in each game; what their sources would otherwise each write the same is here, from a description of where a game
// keeps it (Engine):
//
//   - the training session's view of a player at its step (frame data), a hit landing, and the boxes as the game's
//     hit tests read them, drawn through the game's camera (fight/session.h)
//   - the ring out's own movements at a player's step (fight/battle.h)
//   - widescreen and the invisible walls: the camera kept between its ends and a player kept inside the picture with
//     the wide picture's margin, and the picture made wide (Video::wide)
//   - the model viewer: a round of a two-player match reached unseen, the second player put out of the way, the
//     camera following the first, and the character's animations as the game keeps them (model/model.h)
//
// A game's sources describe it (Describe) before registering these, and give the places of the hooks these make as
// HookAt(0x...), so that the translator finds them in the game's sources (runtime/lift.h). The modes' and the session's own descriptions stay in the game's sources (they are already a
// description of the game to the toolkit); they name the functions here where these do the work.
