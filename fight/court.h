// Court: the "Alternative modes" page's ball game (docs/COURT.md). The stage is a court cut in two by a line down the
// middle of the picture; each fighter stays on its own half, and the two hit a large ball that flies about the whole
// picture. A ball that leaves the picture past a fighter's end is the other's point; first to 3, 5 or 10 wins. The
// fighters' attacks hit the ball (and each other, nobody's health going down), harder attacks sending it faster, and where on the
// ball an attack lands says which way it goes. The ball bounces off a fighter like a soft body; one hit hard enough
// (a super, or a third hit in a row) knocks the fighter it hits down. The camera keeps both fighters and the ball in
// the picture (the zoom by distance, the ball counted: port/zoom.h).
//
// The toolkit's part is the game itself, the same for every fighting game: the ball's flight and bounces, what an
// attack does to it, the rules and the score, the computer's side, the ball drawn and the score shown, the menu's page.
// It runs in the battle modes' match (battle.h: who fights where, the game's computer kept out, no clock, no
// knock-out) as one of their kinds. A game's sources describe the rest (Description): the boxes of its fighters and
// what they throw, how strong an attack is, and the few things done to a fighter (frozen by a hit, knocked down, its
// gauge filled); they keep the fighters on their halves (KeepToHalf).
