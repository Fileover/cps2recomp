# Every game's songs

The names of the files [a custom soundtrack](SOUNDTRACK.md) plays in place of particular songs: name a file as the
first column (`ryu.flac`, `player_select.ogg`) or the number, the second, which is hexadecimal (`12.mp3`,
`0x12.mp3`), with `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.mp3` or `.wav`. A song played once (a fanfare, the versus screen) is played once
whatever the file. Each game also writes this list, as `songs.txt`, into its soundtrack folder, with the music it has
no name for yet by number.

<!-- Made by tools/songs.py from each game's --list-songs: change games/<id>/src/music.cpp, not this. -->
