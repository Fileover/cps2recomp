# A custom soundtrack

Each game can play your own music files in place of the board's music: an arranged soundtrack, say. The sound
effects and voices stay the board's.

1. Switch on **Custom soundtrack** (the Features page, under Sound; it is on in Enhanced, off in Pure).
2. On a game's page, under Sound, **Choose…** the folder your music files are in (`.ogg`, `.flac`, `.mp3` or
   `.wav`). With none chosen, the game uses the `soundtrack` folder in its own settings folder
   (`~/Library/Application Support/<Game>/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/<Game>/` on Linux and Steam Deck,
   `%APPDATA%\<Game>\` on Windows, `user/<Game>/` beside the launcher in [portable mode](LAUNCHER.md#portable-mode)), which
   it makes.

That is all it takes: **a folder of music plays as a playlist**, in place of all the game's music, one file after
another in their names' order (`2 ...` before `10 ...`), and from the first again after the last. Choose **On,
shuffled** for a random order.

**To replace particular songs** instead, name each file after the piece of music it replaces: `ryu.flac`,
`player_select.ogg`, `ken_ending.mp3`. The game writes `songs.txt` into the folder, with every piece of its music
by name and number and what it is (Street Fighter Alpha 2 has 59: each character's theme, each ending, the staff
rolls, the title and the screens between fights). Once one file is named for a song, the folder works this way: a
song you have no file for plays as the board has it, and other files are left alone.

For files with other names, loops and loudness, put `soundtrack.ini` in the folder:

```ini
volume = 80                  ; every song, in percent

[ryu]                        ; a song by its name (or its number: [01])
file = 05 Ryu's Theme.flac
loop = 0:12.5 - 2:47.25      ; the part that repeats: start - end (minutes:seconds, or seconds)
volume = 90
```

A song's file repeats whole unless it says otherwise: by `loop` in `soundtrack.ini`, `loop = no` to play it once, or the
loop tags many soundtrack packs have (`LOOPSTART`, with `LOOPEND` or `LOOPLENGTH`, in samples). The music the board
plays once (a fanfare, the versus screen, a game over) is played once. The music keeps the game's time: pausing,
the menu, slow motion, a save state and run-ahead leave it where the game is (a playlist plays on, and waits only
while the game is held). The game plays exactly the same with
or without it.

No music is included, and this project can't help you get any: use files you made from discs you own.
